#  India IIP Regime & Risk Analysis (2012–2025)

## Executive Summary

This project presents an institutional-style macroeconomic analysis of India's Index of Industrial Production (IIP) from 2012 to 2025.  
The objective is to identify structural growth regimes, volatility cycles, and downside tail-risk events to support data-driven tactical positioning.

### Key Findings

- High volatility regime confirmed (σ = 13%)
- Sharpe Ratio = 0.31 → Weak risk-adjusted performance
- COVID drawdown of -57% → Extreme tail-risk precedent
- Volatility contraction historically precedes recovery phases

This framework simulates how macro risk would be evaluated in an institutional or portfolio management setting.

## Objectives

- Quantify macro volatility regimes
- Measure structural downside tail risk
- Evaluate risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe Ratio)
- Detect momentum shifts using rolling averages
- Translate macro signals into tactical allocation insights

---

## Methodology

- SQL-style data transformation (unpivoting and structuring)
- Year-over-Year (YoY) growth computation
- Volatility (σ) and Sharpe Ratio estimation
- 6-month rolling momentum analysis
- Regime classification using volatility thresholds
- Historical drawdown assessment

---

## Portfolio Implications

- Reduce exposure during high-volatility regimes (σ > 12%)
- Accumulate exposure during volatility contraction phases
- Maintain 20–30% tactical cyclical allocation
- Monitor tail-risk precedents in macro shock environments

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical risk modeling
- SQL-style data transformation
- Power BI (dashboard development)
- Git / GitHub

---

## Future Enhancements

- Fully interactive Power BI dashboard
- Sector-level regime clustering
- Predictive modeling for downturn detection
- Macro risk signal automation
